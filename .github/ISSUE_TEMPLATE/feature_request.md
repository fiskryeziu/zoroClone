## Summary

This proposal aims to enhance the project's user interface by improving the navbar's font, spacing, and overall design to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.

### Motivation

A user-friendly navbar is essential for any web application. It can significantly enhance the user experience by providing clear navigation and a pleasing aesthetic. This enhancement will help attract and retain users, making the project more accessible and enjoyable.

### Proposed Changes

- **Font Selection**: Replace the current font with a more readable and aesthetically pleasing one. Choose fonts that are easy on the eyes and match the project's design theme.

- **Spacing Adjustments**: Improve the spacing between navbar elements, ensuring that they are well-organized and visually appealing. This includes proper margins and padding.

- **Responsive Design**: Make sure the navbar is responsive to different screen sizes, including mobile devices, to maintain a consistent and user-friendly experience across all platforms.

- **Styling Enhancements**: Apply styling improvements such as color choices, hover effects, and possibly icon integration to make the navbar engaging and interactive.

### Example

Here's an example of how the updated navbar might look:

```html
<nav class="navbar">
    <ul class="nav-list">
        <li class="nav-item"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item"><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item"><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
        <li class="nav-item"><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
/* Example CSS for styling the navbar */
.navbar {
    background-color: #333;
    padding: 10px;
}

.nav-list {
    list-style: none;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
}

.nav-item {
    margin: 0 10px;
}

.nav-item a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #fff;
    transition: color 0.3s;
}

.nav-item a:hover {
    color: #ff5733;
}
